# Chili: HTTP Served Hot

***High-Performance Embedded HTTP Server | HTTP Middleware***

### Performance
- Asynchronous I/O and request processing
- Offers response caching for added efficiency
- Autoscaling threadpools: uses less memory when load is light
- Does not overload the CPU or memory when not required

### Flexibility
- File streaming and serving custom streams with async data generation
- Read/Write throttling, both for the server as a whole and for individual connections
- Conditional request message body fetching & rejection

### User Friendliness
- Uses modern C++ and is easy to use, and even to customize the code
- Built-in Profiler to help debug potential performance issues
- Public API documented with Doxygen

### Robustness
- Thoroughly tested with Google Test unit & integration tests
- Stress-tested for memory leaks with Valgrind Memcheck
- Security tested with SlowHTTPTest (DoS simulator)

## Example Code (Hello World)

```c++
int main() {
    auto endpoint = Chili::IPEndpoint({{127, 0, 0, 1}}, 3000);

    auto handler = Chili::RequestHandler([](Chili::Channel& c) {
        auto& res = c.GetResponse();

        res.SetContent("<h1>Hello world!</h1>");
        res.AppendHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
        res.SetStatus(Chili::Status::Ok);

        c.SendResponse();
    });

    auto server = Chili::HttpServer(endpoint, handler);

    auto task = server.Start();
    std::cout << "HelloWorld server started!\n";
    task.wait();
}
```

## Getting Started
### Install Build Prerequisites
Assuming you're on Ubuntu/Debian,

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install cmake libcurl4-gnutls-dev libgtest-dev google-mock libunwind-dev
```
### Compile & Run

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ymarcov/http
$ cd http
$ git submodule update --init
$ cmake .
$ make hello_world
$ bin/hello_world
```

Then connect to `http://localhost:3000` from your browser.

## Documentation (Doxygen)
Documentation may be generated by running ```doxygen Doxyfile```. \
After that, it'll be available under `doc/html/index.html`.

## Performance
Running on Intel i7-3630QM (Laptop) @ 2.40GHz with 8GB of memory, here are SIEGE results. In this test, Chili outperformed all other servers, with *Lighttpd* coming in second. However, keep in mind that those other servers are big, configurable software systems--not simply a library. The test itself was to serve Apache's "It works!" HTML page from each server, as many times as possible, to mainly compare the number of requests served per second.

```bash
$ bin/sandbox_echo 3000 4 0 & # Run sandbox server with 4 threads
$ siege -b -c20 -t5S http://localhost:<PORT>
```
